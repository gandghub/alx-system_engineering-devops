The components of the web infrastructure and their roles:

Server:

A server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In this case, the server hosts the entire web infrastructure for the website.
Domain Name:

A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites on the Internet. It serves as a way to easily identify and remember websites. In this scenario, the domain name is foobar.com, and the www subdomain is commonly used to denote the World Wide Web.
DNS Record:

The www DNS record in www.foobar.com is a subdomain record that points to the IP address of the server (8.8.8.8 in this case). It tells DNS servers how to resolve the domain name to the correct IP address when a user wants to access the website.
Web Server (Nginx):

The web server's role is to handle HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and serve web pages or other web content in response. Nginx is a popular web server software known for its performance, scalability, and versatility.
Application Server:

The application server hosts the application codebase and is responsible for processing dynamic content and generating responses to client requests. It may run applications written in various programming languages such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.
Database (MySQL):

The database stores and manages the website's data. MySQL is a relational database management system commonly used for web applications. It allows for structured storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.
User Communication:

When a user requests the website, their computer sends an HTTP request over the Internet to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). The request is routed through various network devices until it reaches the server hosting the website. The server then processes the request and sends back the requested web page to the user's browser.
