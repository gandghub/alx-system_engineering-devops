Scaling up the web infrastructure, we'll introduce additional components to distribute the workload effectively. Here's the breakdown:

Architecture Overview:
1 Server: Adding another server to increase capacity and handle more incoming requests.
1 Load Balancer (HAProxy): Configured as a cluster to balance traffic across multiple servers.
Split Components: Each component (web server, application server, database) will have its own dedicated server for better resource management and scalability.
Specifics Explanation:
Additional Server:

Adding another server increases the infrastructure's capacity to handle more concurrent users and requests. It distributes the workload and enhances fault tolerance.
Load Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster:

Configuring HAProxy as a cluster allows for redundancy and high availability. If one load balancer fails, the other can seamlessly take over, ensuring uninterrupted service.
Split Components:

Separating components onto dedicated servers allows for better resource allocation and scalability. It prevents one component from impacting the performance of others and facilitates horizontal scaling.
Why Add Each Component:
Web Server: Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and manages client connections.
Application Server: Processes dynamic content, executes server-side logic, and interacts with the database.
Database Server: Stores and manages application data, serving read and write requests.
